PyGression GP is a symbolic regression system written in [Python](http://www.python.org/) using genetic programming techniques. It's inspired by [TinyGP](http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/staff/rpoli/TinyGP), a highly optimised GP system that was originally developed to meet the specifications set out in the TinyGP competition of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO) 2004.
